The game takes place on "Astro Midway". It acts as a sort of gathering place for people who explore the cosmos and shit (im so bad at this) and there is launch stars to the the galaxys people go to Astro Midway from

but bowser like wanted to go boom boom so he like fucked up all the connecting galaxies so mario has to like go to each and get all the power stars and then kill bowser whoop whoop

In the library, there will be optinal books on the different galaxys and how they became the "connecting galaxies" to astro midway (make alot of chat gpted bs stories), as well as how astro midway came to be. for this idfk rosalina and lubba wanted to have a way to visit each other and decided to make a way to connect all of space

-----------------

FLOATY HEIGHTS: Floaty heights became a connecting galaxy to Astro Midway due to the fact its always been a peaceful galaxy, at least before Major Burrows showed up. but its peaceful bunnies and wind made people to enjoy passing by floaty heights to get central :D
